# SOC-hackathon1
tests for 1st SOC hackathon

Improvements/to-do list:

1 - This is a single continent world. Make it work for a 2 continent world where we keep count of the size of each one and compare.

2 - Change the way the world is built so we can actually navigate the world (check out flood fill algorithms)

3 - Please add or remove any items you want from this list.
